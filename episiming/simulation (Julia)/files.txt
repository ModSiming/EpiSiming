Let n be the size of the population.

# ages.eps
    File with Int64 n-vector containing the age of each individual.

# asymptomatic.eps
    File with Boolean n-vector containing whether the individual is going to be asymptomatic or not.

# initialState.eps
    File with n-Int64 vector containing the initial state of each individual where:
        1 - Susceptible
        2 - Exposed
        3 - Asymptomatic
        4 - Infected
        5 - Recovered

# initialTransitions.eps
    File with Int64 matrix (n x 3) containing the transition day for each state where:
        The first columns shows the transition day from Susceptible to Exposed
        The second columns shows the transition day from Exposed to Asymptomatic/Infected
        The third columns shows the transition day from Asymptomatic/Infected to Recovered

# positions.eps
    File with Float64 matrix (n x 2) containing the position for each individual.

# preInfectionPeriod.eps
    File with Int64 n-vector containing the incubation time of each individual.

# rho.eps
    File with Float64 n-vector containing the rho parameter of each individual.

# squares.eps
    File with Int64 n-vector containing the square that each individual belongs.

# viralCharge.eps
    File with Float64 matrix (n x t) where t is the maximum time (someone can be infected), containing the viral charge for each individual at each infection day.

# networks Folder
    Contains all the networks to be considered, for each network let m be its number of particles, the folowing files are required:

    # peopleParticle.eps
        File with Int64 n-vector containing the index of the particle that each individual belongs (if the individual doesn't belong to any particle of that network the value must be -1).

    # position.eps
        File with Float64 matrix (m x 2) containing the position for each particle.
    
    # square.eps
        File with Int64 m-vector containing the square that each particle belongs.
    
    # thetaa.eps
        File with Float64 m-vector containing the transmission rate of asymptomatic individuals inside of each particle.
    
    # thetai.eps
        File with Float64 m-vector containing the transmission rate of infected individuals inside of each particle.
